# Song-Showdown-V1
Inspired by the Songtrivia2 game, I developed my own song guessing game. To learn Socket.io, I adapted the Songtrivia2 game into a professional wrestling theme, adding videos related to this theme to make the application more entertaining. In each round, a song plays, and the player tries to guess the wrestler or artist associated with the song from four given options. The game can be played in single-player or two-player mode. However, when played in two-player mode, the game encounters many issues, such as synchronization problems. After considering how to solve these issues, I realized that I was using Socket.io incorrectly. Therefore, I will create a second version from scratch, but I still wanted to share the first version.
